### Proposal for Federal Legislation to Mandate Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) 

#### Title:
**Federal Solar Renewable Energy Credit (SREC) Program Act**

#### Purpose:
To establish a nationwide requirement for utilities to offer Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) to promote the adoption of solar energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and advance the United States towards a sustainable energy future.

#### Section 1: Short Title
This Act may be cited as the "Federal Solar Renewable Energy Credit (SREC) Program Act."

#### Section 2: Findings
The Congress finds that:
1. Solar energy is a critical component of the nationâ€™s renewable energy strategy.
2. SRECs incentivize individuals and businesses to invest in solar energy systems.
3. Only a few states currently mandate SREC programs, limiting the potential growth of solar energy nationwide.
4. Federal legislation is necessary to ensure a uniform and effective SREC market across the United States.

#### Section 3: Definitions
For the purposes of this Act:
1. **Solar Renewable Energy Credit (SREC)**: A tradable credit that represents one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated from a solar energy system.
2. **Utility**: Any public or private entity that provides electricity to end-users.
3. **Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)**: A regulation that requires the increased production of energy from renewable sources, such as wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal.

#### Section 4: Federal SREC Requirement
1. **Mandate for Utilities**:
   - All utilities operating within the United States shall be required to offer SRECs to their customers who generate solar energy.
   - Utilities must purchase SRECs from customers at a fair market value, which will be determined and regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

2. **Renewable Energy Quotas**:
   - Utilities must ensure that a specified percentage of their energy generation comes from renewable sources, including solar energy, by purchasing SRECs if they cannot meet this quota through their own renewable energy generation.
   - The initial required percentage shall be set at 20% of total energy generation, with a gradual increase to 50% over the next ten years.

#### Section 5: Implementation and Enforcement
1. **Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)**:
   - FERC will oversee the implementation and regulation of the federal SREC program.
   - FERC will establish a standardized pricing mechanism for SRECs to ensure fair compensation for solar energy producers.

2. **Compliance and Penalties**:
   - Utilities failing to comply with the SREC purchase requirements will be subject to fines.
   - Penalties collected from non-compliant utilities will be allocated to a federal renewable energy fund to support further development of solar infrastructure.

#### Section 6: Financial Incentives and Support
1. **Federal Tax Credits**:
   - Extension of federal tax credits for the installation of solar energy systems for both residential and commercial properties.
   - Additional grants and subsidies will be made available to low-income households and small businesses to support the installation of solar energy systems.

2. **Public Awareness Campaign**:
   - A national campaign to educate the public on the benefits of solar energy and the opportunities provided by the federal SREC program.

#### Section 7: Reporting and Review
1. **Annual Reporting**:
   - Utilities will be required to submit annual reports to FERC detailing their compliance with the SREC program, including the number of SRECs purchased and the percentage of energy generated from renewable sources.

2. **Program Review**:
   - A comprehensive review of the SREC program will be conducted every five years to assess its effectiveness and make necessary adjustments.

#### Section 8: Effective Date
This Act shall take effect one year after the date of enactment.

#### Section 9: Authorization of Appropriations
Such sums as may be necessary are authorized to be appropriated to carry out the provisions of this Act.
