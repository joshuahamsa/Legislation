# Resources Directory

Welcome to the **Resources Directory**! This section of the repository is dedicated to collecting and organizing various resources that support and inform legislative proposals and discussions. It includes research papers, articles, legal texts, data sets, and other relevant materials.

## Purpose

The Resources Directory serves several key purposes:

1. **Provide Reference Material**: Offer a comprehensive collection of materials to support the development of legislative proposals.
2. **Enhance Understanding**: Help contributors understand the context, implications, and potential impact of proposed legislation.
3. **Support Evidence-Based Proposals**: Ensure that proposals are grounded in reliable data and research.

## Structure

The directory is organized to make it easy to find and reference materials. The typical structure includes:

- **Category Folders**: Resources are grouped into categories such as `Research Papers`, `Legal Texts`, `Data Sets`, `Articles`, etc.
- **File Naming**: Each file should be named descriptively to reflect its content and source.

Example structure:
```

  │   ├── economic-impact-of-universal-basic-income.pdf
  │   ├── climate-change-legislation-review.docx
