### Proposal for Federal Legislation to Mandate Renewable Energy Consumption and Establish Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)

#### Title:
**Federal Renewable Energy Credit (REC) Program and Major Energy Consumer Mandate Act**

#### Purpose:
To establish a nationwide requirement for the largest energy consumers to ensure a portion of their energy consumption comes from renewable sources, either by direct production or through the purchase of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). This legislation also aims to recognize RECs as a federally regulated financial instrument to facilitate their trade and encourage the development of renewable energy infrastructure.

#### Section 1: Short Title
This Act may be cited as the "Federal Renewable Energy Credit (REC) Program and Major Energy Consumer Mandate Act."

#### Section 2: Findings
The Congress finds that:
1. Renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and geothermal, are essential for a sustainable energy future.
2. Major energy consumers have a significant impact on national energy consumption and carbon emissions.
3. RECs provide a mechanism for energy consumers to contribute to the growth of renewable energy, even if they cannot produce it directly.
4. Recognizing RECs as a federally regulated financial instrument will enable a transparent market, encouraging investment in renewable energy technologies.

#### Section 3: Definitions
For the purposes of this Act:
1. **Renewable Energy Credit (REC)**: A tradable certificate representing one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated from renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and geothermal.
2. **Major Energy Consumer**: Any entity, including corporations, organizations, and government bodies, with annual energy consumption exceeding a cap set by FERC, which may be based on total energy usage or a threshold amount (e.g., 100,000 MWh per year).
3. **Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)**: A regulation requiring increased energy production from renewable sources.

#### Section 4: REC Requirement for Major Energy Consumers
1. **Mandate for Major Energy Consumers**:
   - All major energy consumers within the United States are required to ensure that a specified portion of their energy consumption comes from renewable sources. This can be achieved either through direct production of renewable energy or by purchasing RECs.
   - The initial required percentage of energy consumption from renewable sources shall be set at 10%, increasing incrementally to 30% over the next decade.

2. **Flexibility and Compliance**:
   - Major energy consumers can comply with the mandate by generating renewable energy on-site, purchasing renewable energy through power purchase agreements (PPAs), or buying RECs from the open market to cover any shortfall.
   - FERC will determine the specific compliance requirements and provide guidance on acceptable forms of renewable energy sourcing.

3. **REC Market and Trading**:
   - RECs will be recognized as a federally regulated financial instrument, facilitating their trade on a transparent market.
   - Renewable energy producers can issue RECs for sale to major energy consumers and other entities, creating a market-driven incentive for renewable energy generation.

#### Section 5: Implementation and Enforcement
1. **Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)**:
   - FERC will oversee the implementation, regulation, and monitoring of the REC program and market.
   - FERC will set the cap for major energy consumers and the percentage of energy consumption to be covered by renewable energy or RECs.
   - FERC will establish compliance tracking systems and ensure that REC transactions are recorded and transparent.

2. **Compliance and Penalties**:
   - Major energy consumers that fail to meet the renewable energy or REC purchase requirements will be subject to penalties.
   - Collected penalties will fund federal renewable energy initiatives, supporting the development of renewable energy infrastructure and technologies.

#### Section 6: Financial Instruments and Market Facilitation
1. **Recognition of RECs**:
   - RECs will be recognized as federally regulated financial instruments, facilitating their trade on regulated exchanges.
   - FERC will develop standardized REC contracts and provide guidelines for trading practices.

2. **Tax Credits and Subsidies**:
   - Extension of federal tax credits for investments in renewable energy infrastructure and technology.
   - Additional incentives for small businesses and non-profits to participate in the REC market.

#### Section 7: Public and Corporate Engagement
1. **Awareness Campaign**:
   - A national campaign to educate the public, corporations, and government entities on the benefits of renewable energy and the REC program.

2. **Incentives for Early Adoption**:
   - Major energy consumers that exceed the required percentage of renewable energy consumption or REC purchases ahead of schedule will receive additional tax incentives and public recognition.

#### Section 8: Reporting and Review
1. **Annual Reporting**:
   - Major energy consumers must submit annual reports to FERC detailing their energy consumption and the percentage covered by renewable energy or RECs.

2. **Program Review**:
   - A comprehensive review of the REC program and major energy consumer mandate will occur every five years to assess its effectiveness and suggest necessary adjustments.

#### Section 9: Effective Date
This Act shall take effect one year after the date of enactment.

#### Section 10: Authorization of Appropriations
Such sums as may be necessary are authorized to be appropriated to carry out the provisions of this Act.

---

This legislation mandates that major energy consumers contribute to renewable energy adoption by directly producing renewable energy or purchasing RECs. By recognizing RECs as a federally regulated financial instrument, the Act creates a transparent and robust market that supports the development of renewable energy infrastructure and helps achieve national sustainability goals.
